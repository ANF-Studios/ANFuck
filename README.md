# BrainFuckInterpreter
 A simple Brainfuck interpreter written in C#. This respiratory uses [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/).
### Info
This is a simple brainfuck interpreter that I created (of course following taking some tutorials and some code from others ðŸ‘€) which is a fun little project. I actually want to create a more advanced programming language. I want to thank [Oliver Booth](https://github.com/oliverbooth) for backing me up.

## Usage
### Code
You can get the source and after downloading it, make sure to run `dotnet restore` and to run it `dotnet run`.
### Application
If you want to try out a [release](https://github.com/ANF-Studios/Brainfuck-Interpreter/releases/), just head over and download it, make sure to also get `Program.bf`, which is where it'll get it's code, you can also create your own file, just make sure that it's in the same directory as the executable file and it's named `Program.bf`. Do note that you need .Net Core installed and are running on Windows to use it. If you are not on Windows, you can grab the source code and build it.
